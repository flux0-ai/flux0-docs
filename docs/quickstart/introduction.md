# Introduction

## What is Flux0?

Flux0 is a modern framework for building AI-powered applications with real-time interactions and structured agent orchestration.

AI applications are often difficult to build and scale. You need real-time streaming for seamless conversations, tools for managing agents and workflows, and a way to bridge your backend logic with responsive UIs. Flux0 simplifies all of this.

At its core, Flux0:

- Provides a framework for deploying and managing AI agents.
- Supports multiple LLM providers via frameworks such LangGraph or PydanticAI. - no lock-in.
- Ships with a React toolkit [flux0-ai/react](https://github.com/flux0-ai/flux0-react) for building responsive, event-driven UIs with real-time streaming support.

Flux0 helps you go from idea to working AI product â€” faster, cleaner, and without reinventing the wheel.

## Key Features

Flux0 brings together everything you need to build and scale AI-powered applications:

### ðŸ§  AI Agent Orchestration

Define, deploy, and manage agents using LangGraph, PydanticAI, or custom logic. Flux0 handles the routing and execution flow, so you can focus on behavior, not boilerplate.

### âš¡ Real-Time Streaming

Built-in support for event-driven, streaming responses â€” ideal for chatbots, assistants, and dynamic interfaces.

### ðŸ§© React UI Toolkit

`flux0-ai/react` provides headless React components to quickly build UIs for AI interactions. Handle messages, inputs, system events, widgets and streaming updates with minimal setup.

### ðŸ“¦ Simple, Scalable Project Structure

A batteries-included app scaffold with routes, layouts, data loaders, and state management â€” designed for rapid prototyping and deployment.

### ðŸ”Œ Extensible and Modular

Flux0 is designed to grow with your needs. Customize workflows, add providers, or build new UI behaviors with full TypeScript support.

## Why Use Flux0?

Building modern AI apps is hard â€” especially when you need to coordinate agents, manage streaming data, and build intuitive UIs. Flux0 solves these challenges by offering:

- **Fewer moving parts**: No need to glue together disparate tools for orchestration, state, and UI â€” Flux0 gives you a unified stack.
- **Real-time by default**: From streaming LLM responses to UI updates, Flux0 handles real-time data as a first-class citizen.
- **Provider flexibility**: Swap between OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, or custom backends without rewriting your application logic.
- **Fast prototyping**: Use out-of-the-box project structure and UI components to go from concept to working app in hours, not weeks.
- **Built-in scalability**: Whether you're building a side project or production-scale agent system, Flux0 is designed to scale with you.

If you've ever wrestled with LLM APIs, complex state machines, or messy chat UIs â€” Flux0 is built to make that experience smoother.

## Who is it for?

Flux0 is designed for anyone building AI-powered experiences, including:

- **AI Engineers** who need a structured way to orchestrate agents, workflows, and streaming interactions.
- **Full-Stack Developers** who want to build responsive LLM-powered apps without wrangling low-level infrastructure.
- **Frontend Engineers** looking to build conversational UIs with real-time updates using a React-first toolkit.
- **Researchers & Prototypers** who want to quickly test new agent behaviors or interaction flows in a real app environment.
- **Product Teams** aiming to ship AI features faster with maintainable, scalable code.

Whether youâ€™re building a chatbot, copilot, tutor, or fully autonomous agent â€” Flux0 gives you the foundation to do it well.
